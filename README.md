How to use:

1- Download the latest package from: https://github.com/kaisama/KAI-Model-Modifier/releases

4- Add an FBX or a model in the scene

5- A new root will be created to fix the pivot, orientation and scale

6- You can enter a new name for the root (it will be the model's name by default)

7- You can choose where the new pivot will be related to the model

8- You can enter the new scale and rotation you want

9- By clicking "Apply settings" the model will be created in the scene with the settings you entered

10- By clicking "Export Model To FBX File" a window will popup to select the settings you want for the export
